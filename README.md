AI Concepts - Simple Quiz

# Prompt

Generate a JavaScript-based (only HTML and client-side JS) quiz for ChatGPT beginners. 
Include 10 questions and for each question add 4 answers (1 correct answer and 3 wrong answers). 
Questions must relate to ChatGPT, OpenAI, TensorFlow, Copilot, and AI concepts in general. 
Add a stylesheet to the quiz and use modern sans fonts, with button hover effects. 
Add a quiz timer to the bottom of the page. It should always be on the bottom and visible regardless of scrolling. Implement the timer code. The timer should start as soon as the page is displayed.
Track how many correct and wrong answers, and show the results on top of the page.
Once results are shown, there needs to be a delay of 2 seconds before showing the next question.
On wrong answer, show the correct answer, and pause the timer while the results are displayed.
After final results are displayed, hide the timer, the 'Next Button' color to red, change the text to 'Retry' and when the user clicks it, reload the page.
